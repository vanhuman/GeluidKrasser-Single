## Introduction
GeluidKrasser is a live sampler. One buffer to record live audio to play back using MIDI. Controls include startposition and length of the playback, and volume. Audio and MIDI settings can be configured.

## Installation
1. Place this folder where you want it to be.
2. Download and install SuperCollider 3.13 from the official website: https://supercollider.github.io/downloads.
3. Move all the files and folders in Support_files to ~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider. (Your library folder might be hidden; you get there in the Finder by clicking on the Go menu and then press the Alt key; an extra menu item 'Library' should be added to the list.) If this SuperCollider folder does not exist, create it. If one of the files or folders already exist and you did not make any changes to them that you want to keep, you can override them.
4. You can delete the Support_files folder.
5. Start SuperCollider.

## Configuration
1. Open ~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/startup.scd in the SuperCollider editor.
2. If you want to start GeluidKrasser immediately when starting SuperCollider, look for the line with "~/Desktop/GeluidKrasser/GeluidKrasser.scd", remove the // before it, and change the path to the location of your GeluidKrasser.scd file. Hit save. Next time you start SuperCollider, GeluidKrasser will be automatically loaded.
3. Alternatively, if you want to start GeluidKrasser from the SuperCollider editor, open the GeluidKrasser.scd file, put the cursor somewhere between the outer brackets () and hit Apple-enter. The program is executed and GeluidKrasser starts.
4. SuperCollider can only use an audio interface that is set as default for input and output in the OS X Audio Midi Setup. Make sure that is the case.
5. To configure your audio interface in GeluidKrasser, quit SuperCollider, connect the interface and start it again. Open startup.scd again (from ~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/). In the postwindow (on your right, where all kinds of system messages appear), look for the line 'All available audio devices'. This should also list your audio interface. Copy its name and use it as device1 (which by default is MOTU UltraLite mk3 Hybrid). You can add up to three audio devices. Now restart SuperCollider.
